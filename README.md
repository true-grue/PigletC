# PigletC — a tiny C-like language compiler for [PigletVM](https://github.com/vkazanov/bytecode-interpreters-post)

PigletC is based on [raddsl](https://github.com/true-grue/raddsl) toolset and was made for teaching purposes. 

Simple example.

```c
int r;
int n;

void main() {
  n = 5;
  r = 1;
  while (n > 1) {
    r = r * n;
    n = n - 1;
  }
  print(r);
}
```
Result of compilation.
